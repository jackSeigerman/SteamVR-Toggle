# SteamVR-Toggle
a program to quickly toggle SteamVR folder name to stop applications from launching in VR.
## Getting Started
To use this program, simply go to the "Application" folder and run the "SteamVRToggle.exe". alternatively you can open the solution file located in the "Code" folder in Visual Studio and run, view, or edit the code.

Upon launching the executable, hitting the button "Desktop Mode" will rename the SteamVR folder to SteamVR_ so applications wont auto launch into a VR mode. However if you attempt to open a VR application, it will error. To launch a VR Application you can do either hit the "VR Mode" button replacing the SteamVR_ folder with the original SteamVR folder, or you can just hit the "Launch VR" button to Switch the folder name and launch SteamVR in one button click
##  Important note
This application relies on the steamVR folder being in "C:\Program Files (x86)" wich is the default installation location for it.
